Challenge 1.0

write a javascript program that calculates the monthly paycheck of a
salesperson at a local department store. Every salesperson has
a base salary. The salesperson also receives a bonus at the end
of each month, based on the following criteria: if the
salesperson has been with the store for five years or less, the
bonus is $10 for each year that he or she has worked there. If
the salesperson has been with the store for more than five years,
the bonus is $20 for each year that he or she has worked there.
The salesperson can earn an additional bonus as follows: if the
total sales made by the salesperson for the month are at least
$5, 000 but less than $10,000, he or she receives a 3% commission
on the sale. If the total sales made by the salesperson for the
month are at least $10, 000, he or she receives a 6% commission
on the sale.
