#Challenge 1.0

#write a python program that calculates the monthly paycheck of a
#salesperson at a local department store. Every salesperson has
#a base salary. The salesperson also receives a bonus at the end
#of each month, based on the following criteria: if the
#salesperson has been with the store for five years or less, the
#bonus is $10 for each year that he or she has worked there. If
#the salesperson has been with the store for more than five years,
#the bonus is $20 for each year that he or she has worked there.
#The salesperson can earn an additional bonus as follows: if the
#total sales made by the salesperson for the month are at least
#$5, 000 but less than $10,000, he or she receives a 3% commission
#on the sale. If the total sales made by the salesperson for the
#month are at least $10, 000, he or she receives a 6% commission
#on the sale.

#Variables
FirstBonus = 10
SecondBonus = 20
MonthlyBonus = 0

#Interface and Input
Salary = input ("Enter Your Salary: ")
NumOfYears = input("How Many Years Have You Been Working?: ")
TotalSales = input("Enter Your Total Sales For The Month: ")

#Calc for Monthly Bonus
if int(NumOfYears) <= 5:
    float(MonthlyBonus) = FirstBonus * int(NumOfYears)
else:
    float(MonthlyBonus) = SecondBonus * int(NumOfYears)

#Calc for Additional Bonus
if float(TotalSales) >= 5000 and float(TotalSales) < 10000:
    AdditionalBonus = 0.03 * float(TotalSales)
elif float(TotalSales) >= 10000:
    AdditionalBonus = 0.06 * float(TotalSales)
else:
    AdditionalBonus = 0

TotalBonus = MonthlyBonus + AdditionalBonus

#Calc for Total Paycheck
TotalPaycheck = float(Salary) + TotalBonus
print("Good Work This Month!")
print("Your Monthly Bonus is: $", MonthlyBonus)
print("Your Additional Bonus is: $", AdditionalBonus)
print("Your Total Bonus is: $", TotalBonus)
print("Your Total Paycheck is: $", TotalPaycheck)
print("Thank You For Working With Us!")
