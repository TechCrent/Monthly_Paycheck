#Challenge 1.0

#write a c++ program that calculates the monthly paycheck of a
#salesperson at a local department store. Every salesperson has
#a base salary. The salesperson also receives a bonus at the end
#of each month, based on the following criteria: if the
#salesperson has been with the store for five years or less, the
#bonus is $10 for each year that he or she has worked there. If
#the salesperson has been with the store for more than five years,
#the bonus is $20 for each year that he or she has worked there.
#The salesperson can earn an additional bonus as follows: if the
#total sales made by the salesperson for the month are at least
#$5, 000 but less than $10,000, he or she receives a 3% commission
#on the sale. If the total sales made by the salesperson for the
#month are at least $10, 000, he or she receives a 6% commission
#on the sale.
